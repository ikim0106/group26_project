## makefile commands

compile code:
```
make comp
```
&nbsp;

run code:
```
make run
```
&nbsp;

clear old .class files: 
```
make clear
```

&nbsp;

clear, comp, and run:

```
make all
```

&nbsp;

if you run into an error about some .class files not existing:
```
make comp
make all
```
should do the trick

&nbsp;

before committing to the repo, running
```
make clear
```
would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
